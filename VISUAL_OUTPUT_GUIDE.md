# 🎯 Visual Heatmap & Analysis Output Guide

## What You Should See After Analysis

When you run an analysis on your landing page, you'll get a comprehensive visual and data output that includes:

### 🔥 **Visual Heatmap (Red Overlay)**
- **Saliency Grid**: A 12x8 grid overlay showing attention areas
- **Red Intensity**: Darker red = higher attention, lighter red = lower attention
- **Heatmap Generation**: AI analyzes visual elements and creates attention probability map

### 📍 **CTA Annotations (Green Boxes)**
- **Bounding Boxes**: Green rectangles around detected call-to-action buttons
- **Labels**: Text showing "CTA: [button text]"
- **Priority Levels**: Color-coded by importance (1-5 scale)

### 👥 **Person Detection (Blue Boxes)**
- **Human Figures**: Detected people in the image
- **Emotion Analysis**: Inferred emotional states
- **Gaze Direction**: Whether people are looking toward CTAs

### 📊 **Analysis Results Display**

## 🎨 **How the Heatmap is Generated**

1. **Image Processing**: Your landing page screenshot is analyzed
2. **Grid Division**: Image is divided into 12x8 grid cells
3. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI Vision analyzes each cell for attention probability
4. **Saliency Calculation**: Each cell gets a score from 0.0 to 1.0
5. **Visual Overlay**: Scores are converted to red intensity overlay
6. **CTA Detection**: AI identifies and locates call-to-action elements
7. **Person Detection**: Human figures are detected and analyzed
8. **Final Composition**: All overlays are combined into final image

## 🔍 **Understanding the Colors**

- **🔴 Red Overlay**: Attention heatmap (darker = more attention)
- **🟢 Green Boxes**: CTA locations with labels
- **🔵 Blue Boxes**: Person detection (if people are present)
- **⚪ Base Image**: Your original landing page screenshot

## 📱 **Viewing Your Results**

### **Option 1: Demo Page**
- Visit `/demo` to see a sample output
